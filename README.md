# hermes-client

Created in [T3 Code](https://t3.codes).

A Tauri 2 + React desktop chat client for one remote Hermes Agent server. It signs in over SSH (see `docs/adr/0003-sign-in-through-ssh-tunnel-to-the-dashboard.md`).

## Run

You need the Tauri 2 prerequisites on Arch:

```sh
sudo pacman -S --needed rust webkit2gtk-4.1 base-devel curl wget file openssl appmenu-gtk-module libappindicator-gtk3 librsvg
```

Then, from the repo root:

```sh
npm install
npm run app
```

`npm run app` sets `WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1`, which fixes the blank WebKitGTK window on some Wayland setups.

To sign in, enter an SSH target whose key works without a prompt (for example `liam@hermes`, or an alias from `~/.ssh/config`), plus the Hermes dashboard username and password.

## Test

```sh
npm test                                  # frontend transport against a fake Hermes
cd src-tauri && cargo test --test transport   # Rust transport against a stub server
```
